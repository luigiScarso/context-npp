Currently the plugin has to be installed by manually copying 
the files into the folder listed below.
The plugin is compiled for Notepad++ 7.5.1 32-bit x86
that is assumed installed under 
C:\Program Files (x86)\Notepad++
It should work for later release of Notepad++ 32-bit. x86
It doesn't work for Notepad++ 64-bit.

Before installation, be sure that there are not
instances of Notepad++ running.
Download and unzip Npp-for-ConTeXt.zip into a suitable 
folder (e.g Desktop/context-npp) and then copy 
the global files from
Npp-for-ConTeXt\Program Files (x86)\Notepad++
into 
C:\Program Files (x86)\Notepad++

The files for the local setup has to be copied into the
%APPDATA% folder, i.e. from 
Npp-for-ConTeXt\Roaming\Notepad++
into 
C:\Users\{username}\AppData\Roaming\Notepad++

Once started, under Language there should be the ConTexT item,
and Plugins should have the ConTeXt item too.
